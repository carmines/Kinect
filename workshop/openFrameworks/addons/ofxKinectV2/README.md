ofxKinectV2
===========

This is an openFrameworks addon for working with the Microsoft SDK for the Kinect V2. There's a few caveats: you need a fairly specific setup to get this working. You'll need

* A computer with a USB 3 port
* Windows 8.1
* [Visual Studio 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/)
* [A Kinect V2](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/Purchase/developer-sku.aspx)
* The Kinect V2 SDK (will be released to the public in July)
* [openFrameworks with all the poco libs compiled for 2013](https://github.com/liquidzym/openFrameworks/tree/VS2013)

Just to answer a few of the initial questions:

Can I use this on OSX?

Nope.

Can I use this on Windows 7?

Nope.

Can I use this on Linux?

Nope.

Why not?

Because we're just wrapping the functionality provided by the Microsoft Kinect team.

Where's speech recognition and face tracking?

Coming soon.
